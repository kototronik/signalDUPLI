# **signalDUPLI**  
*A Signal Duplicator for ASK Modulated Signals*

## **Overview**  
**signalDUPLI** is a tool that enables you to replicate ASK-modulated signals using RTL-SDR, Universal Radio Hacker (URH), and an ESP32-based transmitter setup. This tool processes signal data from text files, generates corresponding binary output files, and optionally uploads them to a server for further signal generation.

## **Requirements**  
1. **Software**  
   - [rtl-433](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433)  
   - [Universal Radio Hacker (URH)](https://github.com/jopohl/urh)  

2. **Hardware**  
   - ESP32 microcontroller  
   - ASK-compatible transmitter module (connected to GPIO 4 on the ESP32)  

---

## **Setup Guide**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
1. **Download and install rtl-433**  
   Follow the instructions from the [rtl-433 repository](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433).  

2. **Download and install Universal Radio Hacker (URH)**  
   Follow the instructions from the [URH repository](https://github.com/jopohl/urh).  

---

### **Step 2: Upload Firmware**  
1. Flash the provided firmware to your ESP32 microcontroller.  

---

### **Step 3: Connect the Transmitter**  
1. Connect your ASK transmitter to the **GPIO 4** pin on the ESP32.  

---

### **Step 4: Capture Signals**  
1. Run **rtl-433** with the following command:  
   ```bash
   rtl_433 -S all
   ```
   OR
   
   ```bash
   rtl_433 -S known
   ```

2. Wait for the signal file to appear. You can also use other commands, or record the signal manually.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze Signals**  
1. Open the signal file in **Universal Radio Hacker (URH)**.  

2. Set the following parameters in URH:  
   - **Samples/Symbol:** `1`  
   - **Error Tolerance:** `5`  
   - **Modulation:** `ASK`  
   - **Bit/Symbol:** `1`  
   - **Show Data As:** `Hex`  

3. Your URH interface should look similar to this:  
   ![URH Example](https://github.com/kototronik/signalDUPLI/blob/main/1.png?raw=true)  

4. Copy the resulting **data array**.  

---

### **Step 6: Prepare Data**  
1. Paste the copied data into `input.txt`.  

---

### **Step 7: Replicate Signals**  
1. Run the provided Python script to transmit the signal.

## **TXTtoESP32.py Usage Guide**

### **Syntax**
```bash
python TXTtoESP32.py [-h] [-i INPUT] [-o OUTPUT] [-s SAMPLE_RATE] [-ns]
```

### **Options**
| Flag               | Description                                                                                     | Default Value              |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `-h, --help`       | Display the help message and exit.                                                              | â€”                          |
| `-i, --input`      | Specify the input file with signal data.                                                        | `input.txt`               |
| `-o, --output`     | Specify the name of the output binary file.                                                     | `output_durations.bin`    |
| `-s, --sample-rate`| **Specify the sample rate in kHz**. **This must be the same sample rate that was used during signal recording**. Overrides the stored value in the configuration file.           | Configured sample rate or prompted |
| `-ns, --no-send`   | Disable file upload to the server. By default, the file is uploaded after processing.           | Enabled (Upload by default)|

### **New Features**  
- **Dynamic Sample Rate Configuration**  
  You can now specify the sample rate in kHz using the `-s` option, which **must match the sample rate** used during the recording of the signal. This value overrides the stored configuration. If not provided, the script will prompt you to enter the sample rate or use the stored value from `config.json`.

- **Configurable Input and Output Files**  
  The `-i` and `-o` options allow you to specify custom input and output files for the signal processing. By default, `input.txt` and `output_durations.bin` are used.

- **Improved Signal Processing and Error Handling**  
  The script processes signal data, calculates durations, and writes the results to a binary output file. It includes better error handling, such as limiting pause values to ensure they stay within valid ranges.

- **Upload Option**  
  After processing, the output file can be uploaded to a server for further signal generation. This feature can be disabled using the `-ns` option.

---

### **Examples**
1. **Process data and upload the file (default behavior):**
   ```bash
   python TXTtoESP32.py -i input.txt -o output_durations.bin
   ```

2. **Process data without uploading to the server:**
   ```bash
   python TXTtoESP32.py -i input.txt -ns
   ```

3. **Specify a custom sample rate (important: use the same rate as was used during signal recording) and process data:**
   ```bash
   python TXTtoESP32.py -i input.txt -o output_durations.bin -s 192
   ```

4. **Use default input and output file names:**
   ```bash
   python TXTtoESP32.py
   ```

5. **Display the help message:**
   ```bash
   python TXTtoESP32.py -h
   ```

---

## **Configuration File**  
The script uses a configuration file (`config.json`) to store the sample rate setting. **Ensure that the sample rate stored or entered is the same rate that was used when recording the signal**. If the file doesn't exist or is corrupted, the script will prompt you to enter the sample rate.
